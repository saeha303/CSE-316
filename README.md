FORGET ME NOT

CSE 316 Microcontroller project by 1905033, 1905049, 1905053, 1905055, 1905056

Our Project "Forget Me Not" is an automated Gardening system. Here we implemented an automated watering system based on the humidity of the soil. We also implemented an automated shedding if the temperature rises too high. If the water tank is empty, the bot will notify the user via telegram. Components Used- YL 69( Soil Moisture Sensor), Water level Sensor, DHT11(Temperature and humidity sensor), Stepper Motor, Arduino Uno, ESP32
